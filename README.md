# Analysing-Employee-s-Performance-for-HR-Analytics
"This project to use SQL to analyze a real-world database, how to extract the most useful information from the dataset, how to pre-process the data using Python for improved performance, and how to use a structured query language to retrieve useful information from the database."
# Pre-processing the dataset:
Worked on handling null values, deletion or transformation of irrelevant values, data type transformation, removing duplicates and data validations. Once you have completed this task, you will get a refined and a cleaner data set for further analysis.
Uncleaned_emplyees_final_dataset.csv for analysis.
# performed Data Pre-processing:
1: Removing duplicate rows 2: Removing rows for which numeric columns are having irrelevant data type values 3: Remove irrelevant values from each column if any. Validation of all values for a column Check for any inconsistencies or discrepancies in data types, units, or formats. Feel free to add more validation checks which you might feel necessary for the datasetâ€™s integrity 4: Export the cleaned dataset as a .csv file: prefer UTF-8 encoding. 5: Convert the pre-processed dataset into an SQL file and generate employee table from employee.csv
# Table Name: employee
Table Columns: employee_id, department, region, education, gender, recruitment_channel, no_of_trainings, age, previous_year_rating, length_of_service, KPIs_met_more_than_80, awards_won, avg_training_score
